# Step-by-step Shiny Examples

This is a pair of Shiny apps for use in illustrating two journeys - the first, from a very simple to a more useful app, the second, from a very slow to a quite performant version of the same data.

They were created for the R-Ladies Boston Intro to Shiny tutorial scheduled for 4/16/19. I will link to the slides from this README when they are finished. Or possibly slightly later ðŸ˜³
